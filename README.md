# ConfigHack
Loads the game config slightly later and from a different file.

This mod allows you to still save game settings after symlinking the regular config file to /dev/null as described in [this thread](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6044#issuecomment-1207293309). You should only need to do this if you are using VR.
